We all have different levels ok skills with the design tools we will be exploring. This class being open to everyone, we would like to take on telling a story. 

This exploration will look at the following workflow:
1. Collecting images, looking at places to store images taken with cell phones
2. Processing the images with photoshop
3. Referencing photoshop files for use with Illustrator
4. Composing layouts with Illustrator
5. Creating multiple layouts with Illustrator

So what kind of story do you want to tell?

1. I would like to tell a story of a final project from a studio class I took.

2. I would like to tell a story of my neighborhood.
