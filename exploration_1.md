We all have different levels ok skills with the design tools we will be exploring. This class being open to everyone, we would like to take on telling a story. 

### This exploration will look at the following workflow:
1. Collecting images, looking at places to store images taken with cell phones
2. Processing the images with photoshop
3. Referencing photoshop files for use with Illustrator
4. Composing layouts with Illustrator
5. Creating multiple layouts with Illustrator

### So what kind of story do you want to tell?
For the next class session you will select a series of 20 images to talk about your project or neighborhood.

With your 20 images, you will have 20 seconds each to present them to the class in a presentation style known as Pecha Kucha.

Basically many architects and designer go on and on talking way too much. This style makes us think, and hopefully prepare a better way to present.

#### For those talking about your studio project
So you have 20 slides, how would you go about talking about your project? Are there any themes or ideas you want to emphasize? What kind of drawings do you think would help? Maybe it's about entirely about the project, maybe its how you went about it. Think that each slide is on the projector for 20 seconds and it will automatically go to the next slide.

#### For those talking about a street or neighborhood
So you have 20 slides, how would you talk about the street or neighborhood? Do you do it as about you experience it? Do you talk about certain objects (like buildings, signs, people). Given that you may not have photos to work with, take the time to go to the site and take photographs or google streetview.
